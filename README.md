# Multi-Genre-Instant-Music-Generator
This Python program allows producers to generate a MIDI chord progression and bassline in seconds. It saves the useable MIDI file in the directory of this code when run. The MIDI, when dragged out, has chords on top of the bassline.

Future updates (very soon):
- Genre expansion. Will include more genres like Jungle, Lo-Fi, etc.
- Stronger chord progressions.
- More chord progressions per genre.
- Adding drum elements/randomization.
