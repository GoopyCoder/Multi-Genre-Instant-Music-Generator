# Multi-Genre-Instant-Music-Generator
This Python program allows producers to generate a MIDI chord progression and bassline in seconds.
WARNING: This project currently only runs on my computer's specifications. File creation and saving feature will be adjusted to allow all users to run properly within the next month.

Future updates (very soon):
- Genre expansion. Will include more genres like Jungle, Lo-Fi, etc.
- Stronger chord progressions.
- More chord progressions per genre.
