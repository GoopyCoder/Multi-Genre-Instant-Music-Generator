# Multi-Genre-Instant-Music-Generator
This Python program allows producers to generate a MIDI chord progression, bassline, and drums in seconds. It saves the useable MIDI file in the directory of this code when run. The MIDI, when dragged out, has chords on top of the bassline.

WHAT'S NEW:
- Added some basic DRUM LOOPS in MIDI! The order they are dragged onto the track is chords, bassline, kick, snare, and closed hi-hat.
- The drum tracks are RANDOMIZED! You get a random combination of drum tracks upon MIDI generation.
- More Chord Progressions!

Future updates (very soon):
- Genre expansion. Will include more genres like House, Lo-Fi, etc.
- Stronger chord progressions.
- More chord progressions per genre.
